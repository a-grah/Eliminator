# Eliminator

The Eliminator casts votes for contestants that are up for elimination.

If you are a fan of Battle For Dream Island (BFDI) here is your chance to host your own battles.  You specify four contestents up for elimination and Eliminator will cast the votes.

Take the loser to your very own tiny loser chamber or locker of losers. Keep them there until you have the winner.

This can be deployed as an electron app or on a simple web server.
